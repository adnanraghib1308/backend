# Backend for fetching result through roll number

This is a backend application for our front end app - https://github.com/adnanraghib1308/frontend which is deployed on https://frontendrollno.herokuapp.com/.
This application uses nodejs and expressjs to fetch data from external api https://terriblytinytales.com/testapi?rollnumber=123 which returns either pass/fail as raw data. Our backend convert this data into json which can be fetched through https://backendrollno2.herokuapp.com/test/12.
This is api is used by our front end react app to show data in tabular form.
